## 🌌 Overview
**SymbioticAI-15D-X** is a speculative yet technically rigorous Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed to model the transition from an **Attention Economy** to an **Awareness Economy**. 

Instead of traditional agents that maximize engagement at any cost, this system uses a **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** agent trained across 15 overlapping dimensions of meaning (The 15D Engine). The goal is to reach a symbiotic equilibrium between algorithmic performance, cognitive health, and systemic stability.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core:** Python 3.12+
- **Validation:** Pydantic V2 (Strict Type Enforcement)
- **Environment:** Gymnasium (Custom 15D Environment)
- **RL Brain:** Stable-Baselines3 (PPO with Custom Neural Architecture)
- **Quantum Layer:** Qiskit/Aer (Simulated Quantum Entropy for Shadow Noise)
- **Logging:** Loguru

## 🧬 The 15D Dimensions (Core Logic)
The environment monitors 5 key vectors (collapsing the 15 dimensions for computational efficiency):
1. **Cognitive Load:** Mental fatigue vs. Focus.
2. **Information Diversity:** Filter bubble resistance.
3. **Session Entropy:** Temporal decay of meaning.
4. **Somatic Resonance:** User physical well-being.
5. **Technological Shadow:** Entropy generated by bots and inauthentic data (injected via Quantum RNG).
